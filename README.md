# NXP-AES-Project 
A Project of three Master Engineering-Students at the university of applied sciences in Landshut Germany (Ambrosch Markus, Summer Matthias and Ecker Christian).

## 1.1 Information
The goal of the project is the construction and programming of a model vehicle for the Next Experience (NXP) Cup with a specially built, self-driving vehicle. In this competition the 1:18 scale vehicles must drive safely and independently through a course in the shortest possible time. The roadway is bordered by two black stripes applied to a white background. The vehicle must recognize these limitations and, based on their evaluation, adjust the speed of the vehicle and its steering angle.
