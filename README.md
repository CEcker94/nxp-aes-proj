# NXP-AES-Project 
A Project of three Master Students at the university of applied sciences in Landshut Germany.

## 1.1 Introduction
The goal of the project is the construction and programming of a model vehicle for the Next Experience (NXP) Cup with a specially built, self-driving vehicle. In this competition the 1:18 scale vehicles must drive safely and independently through a course in the shortest possible time. The roadway is bordered by two black stripes applied to a white background. The vehicle must recognize these limitations and, based on their evaluation, adjust the speed of the vehicle and its steering angle. The car is driven
by two brushless direct current motors (BLDC motors). The steering is realized with a servo drive.
